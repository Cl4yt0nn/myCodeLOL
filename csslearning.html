        <p><strong>HTML5</strong> is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the <strong>World Wide Web.</strong> It was first released on 22 January 2008. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers. HTML5 is used in the vast majority of websites on the web, and <strong>CSS</strong> is used in hand with HTML5 to decorate these websites and improve the overall User Experience. CSS contributed to HTML by making tags/commands dedicated to customizing the look of the website, such as &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, and many more. It also implemented many new commands, some being the &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; tags, the &lt;link&gt; tag, and the &lt;canvas&gt; tag. HTML is necessary to create web pages as that's its real main purpose. Even website-making websites use HTML to create said sites and the site itself uses HTML to run. <strong>JavaScript, PHP,</strong> and other coding languages are actually known as <strong>scripting languages,</strong> which are used with HTML but are more expansive than it.</p>
